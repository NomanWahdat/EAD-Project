# EAD-Project

Data Processing Application Description:

The Data Processing Application is a sophisticated web tool meticulously crafted to undertake heavy data processing tasks, specifically focusing on the calculation of square roots within arrays. Leveraging the power of Web Workers, this application seeks to redefine the boundaries of computational efficiency in web development.

Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface:
   - The application boasts an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. Web Workers Integration:
   - By incorporating Web Workers, the application optimizes the processing of square root calculations, preventing UI freezes and enhancing overall responsiveness.

3. Real-time Performance Metrics:
   - Users can dynamically observe and compare the performance of two processing modes: one without Web Workers and the other harnessing the background threading capabilities.

4. Educational Emphasis:
   - Beyond its practical application, the project serves as an educational resource, shedding light on the advantages of integrating Web Workers for improved data processing in web development.

How to Use:

1. Enter an array of numbers into the designated input field.
2. Initiate processing with a click of a button.
3. Observe real-time performance metrics and the computed square roots.

Explore the intersection of computational power and user-centric design with the Data Processing Application, where the utilization of Web Workers transforms complex calculations into a seamless and efficient experience.
